# Hackfest services

This is the checklist to prepare the services for an e-Research Hackfest. It assumes that you will be running a full hackfest. If you are running a pared-down or specialised hackfest, then select the bits that you want in your fork.

# Services

Services necessary for the hackfest are :

  1. Participant development environment - the golden standard for the development environment for the participants
  1. Integration platform - instances of the service comprising the platform that the participants will code against.

## Development environment - Automated deployment

### Participant information

  1. [ ] Collect the final participants list. Ensure that you have :
      * Name and Surname
      * email address
      * preferred user name
      * ssh public key

      Of each participant.
  1. [ ] Add these to group_vars file

### Deployment

  1. [ ] Decide on the cloud provider you will be using.
     * Private Cloud (OpenStack) :
       * [ ] Check whether you have access to the Nova interface, so that you can deploy machines using DevOps tools.
       * [ ] Run the deloyment-setup playbook.
     * Commercial provider : Request _large_ VM from your provider which will be used by all participants _or_ request a _small_ VM from your provider _per participant_
  1. [ ] Ensure that the organiers ssh keys are assigned to a deployment user (_e.g._ `ansible`)
  1. [ ]


### Development Environment - manual

**Nova with Cloud-Init**

  1. [ ] Create the VM using the cloud-init file in `static-files`:
      ```
        nova boot <template name> --flavor <flavour defined in nova> --image <image id from glance> --security-groups <group from nova> --user-data <cloud init file> --poll
      ```
      _e.g._
      ```
        nova boot fg-hackfest --flavor medium --image dd66a06a-7414-49ea-becc-04a45f5bfb6c --security-groups 837af793-12f5-409c-8919-5d0545041881 --user-data futuregateway_cloud-init --poll
      ```
  1. [ ] Assign IP :
      ```
        nova floating-ip-associate <template name> <ip>
      ```
      _e.g._
      ```
        nova floating-ip-associate fg-hackfest 151.97.41.44
      ```

## Integration platform

The integration platform needs to be available in order to do continuous integration of the participant applications.


### Requirements

The integration platform consists of a Jenkins service which runs the tests

  1. [ ] Fork the Jenkins config repo
  1. [ ] Edit group_vars for your event
  1. [ ]
