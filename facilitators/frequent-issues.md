# warmup problems

This should contain the typical frequently-encountered issues for various things. Try to list them according to the place where the _solution_ is made, not necessarily where the _problem_ is diagnosed.

## General problems

Stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else

  * We need a reliable way to broadcast information to the participants
    * this could be slack, gitter, twitter, or etherpad.
    * This could also simply be a whiteboard or flipchart
  * At some point, the users "get" it, and they start looking at the big picture. We need some kind of growth path that suggests how the applications can move to production.


## Network problems

  * ensure that the firewall can allow several connections

## Git problems

  * Installing Git Bash : there isn't a very clear process to install git bash
  * Git bash on Windows doesn't allow https cloning - use the GUI


## SSH problems

  * Git bash ssh - git bash creates ssh keys with a file name `github_rsa` instead of `id_rsa`. This should be circumvented by copying the `github_rsa` files to `id_rsa`

## OAR problems

  * would be nice to have a json<->xml converter
